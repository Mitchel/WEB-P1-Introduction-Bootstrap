# WEB-P1: Introduction Bootstrap
For my school education Software Development we studied Bootstrap for period 1. We had to make our own website with various requirements but were not allowed to add our own style, so everything had to consist of the style of Bootstrap itself.

The elaboration has become a very ugly website, which doesn't suit me at all, but was made according to the assignment. My final grade for this project is a **9.7**.

## Requirements
- A Bootstrap starter template
- A navbar
- A carousel with 6 images
- A responsive grid with at least 8 filled cards
- Extras from the lessons have been incorporated into the site (favicon.ico, large buttons, etc....).
